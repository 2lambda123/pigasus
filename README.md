# Pigasus 2.0
<img align="right" width="200" src="./pigasus_logo.png">

Pigasus is an Intrusion Detection and Prevention System (IDS/IPS) that achieves 100Gbps using a single FPGA-equipped server. Pigasus' FPGA-first design ensures that most packets are processed entirely using the FPGA, while some packets are sent to the CPU for full evaluation. Refer to the [OSDI '20 paper](https://www.usenix.org/conference/osdi20/presentation/zhao-zhipeng) and [Zhipeng Zhao's PhD Thesis](http://users.ece.cmu.edu/~jhoe/distribution/2021/zhao.pdf) for details about the design.

Compared to Pigasus 1.0, Pigasus 2.0 enables easy customization and more efficient scaling of the Pigasus design. For more details, please refer to the [Pigasus_Release](pigasus_release.md).

If you want to run Pigasus as it is, without customization, please go to `./pigasus` directly. 

## Customize Pigasus
Instructions on how to use the connection types and a short tutorial are available in the comments of `pigasus.py`. To use the single-FPGA Pigasus 2.0 design, run `./run_pigasus.sh`. To use the multi-FPGA version, run `./run_pigasus_multi.sh`.

Directory organization
* `run_pigasus.sh`: driver script for single-FPGA Pigasus. This is what most users should need.
* `run_pigasus_multi.sh`: driver script for multi-FPGA Pigasus.
* `pigasus`: contains the RTL code for single-FPGA Pigasus' modules. See [Pigasus README](pigasus/README.md) for RTL simulation instructions.
* `pigasus_multi`: contains the RTL code for multi-FPGA Pigasus' modules. See [Pigasus Multi README](pigasus_multi/README.md) for RTL simulation instructions.
* `pigasus.py`: front end to drive Fluid for constructing Pigasus 2.0 designs. The comments in this file mention how to customize Pigasus 2.0.
* `pigasus_multi.py`: front end to drive Fluid for constructing multi-FPGA Pigasus 2.0 designs. The structure of this file is similar to `pigasus.py`, therefore the documentation is the same and is only present in `pigasus.py`.
* `fluid`: contains a minimal version of Fluid for constructing Pigasus 2.0 designs:
    * `header.py`: main Fluid interface.
    * `genericplatform.py`: platform-independent Fluid implementation (there are platform-dependent versions for OPAE and Xilinx Arty boards).
    * `parse_ast.py`: an internal representation of Verilog code as an AST in Python, for use in the generator.
    * `vtl.py`: Verilog Templating Language, a custom DSL for writing Verilog from Python code, used to quickly construct Verilog code snippets for the generator.
    * `visualizer.py`: Graphviz-based visualizer of the design generated by Fluid. 
    * `services.py`: Fluid definitions of Pigasus modules. This is also a good reference for constructing your own Fluid classes.
    * `connections.py`: Python functions to wrap the base connection type to make more complex connections, such as the auto clock-crossing ChannelFIFO used between Pigasus modules.
* `top_base.sv`, `top0_base.sv`, `top1_base.sv`: Some generic SystemVerilog code that needs to be pasted into the final generated design.
