# Fluid (minimal version)
Fluid is a framework for constructing latency insensitive designs. Refer to [Joe Melber's PhD Thesis](http://users.ece.cmu.edu/~jhoe/distribution/2021/melber.pdf)
for more details. This is a very minimal subset of Fluid meant just for customizing Pigasus 2.0. Fluid accepts design descriptions as modules connected via
latency-insensitive channels and transforms that into RTL. The modules and connections between them can be controlled through a Python API.

This subset of Fluid is written in Python 3 only and has no external depdendencies. Using the visualizer however requires installing graphviz and PyGraphviz.

Directory structure
* `header.py`: main Fluid interface.
* `genericplatform.py`: platform-independent Fluid implementation.
* `parse_ast.py`: an internal representation of Verilog code as an AST in Python, for use in the generator.
* `vtl.py`: Verilog Templating Language, a custom DSL for writing Verilog from Python code, used to quickly construct Verilog code snippets for the generator.
* `visualizer.py`: Graphviz-based visualizer of the design generated by Fluid. 
* `services.py`: Fluid definitions of Pigasus modules. This is also a good reference for constructing your own Fluid modules.
* `connections.py`: Python functions to wrap the base connection type to make more complex connections, such as the auto clock-crossing ChannelFIFO used between Pigasus modules.
